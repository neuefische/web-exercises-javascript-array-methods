Exercises to learn and practice the `Array` methods:

## Validate your solutions

For each exercise you can run automated tests which will validate your code.
To start the test you simply run `npm run test:1` for the first exercise. Change the number after the colon for each exercise accordingly (e.g. `npm run test:2` for exercise 2).
